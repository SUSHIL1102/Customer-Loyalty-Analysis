# Customer Loyalty Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that focuses on analyzing customer loyalty using a dataset from a UK-based online retail store. The notebook explores various metrics and techniques to measure and enhance customer loyalty.

## Project Overview

Customer loyalty is a critical factor for the success of any business, particularly in e-commerce. This project aims to develop a robust framework for measuring and improving customer loyalty by analyzing transactional data. The analysis is based on the Online Retail Dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Online Retail Dataset from Kaggle, which contains transactional data for a UK-based online retail store from 2010-2011. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `InvoiceNo`: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction.
- `StockCode`: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
- `Description`: Product (item) name. Nominal.
- `Quantity`: The quantities of each product per transaction. Numeric.
- `InvoiceDate`: Invoice date and time. Numeric, in a mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm format.
- `UnitPrice`: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.
- `CustomerID`: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
- `Country`: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where the customer resides.

## Analysis Outline

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning the data: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   - Data transformation: Creating additional features and variables as needed for the analysis.

### 2. **Customer Segmentation**
   - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis: Segmenting customers based on their purchase behavior.
   - K-Means Clustering: Grouping customers into segments with similar characteristics.

### 3. **Loyalty Metrics**
   - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Estimating the total value a customer brings to the company.
   - Churn Prediction: Identifying customers who are likely to stop purchasing from the store.
   - Cohort Analysis: Tracking customer behavior over time to understand loyalty trends.

### 4. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Machine Learning Models: Using predictive models to forecast customer behavior and loyalty.
   - Feature Importance: Analyzing the most significant factors that drive customer loyalty.

### 5. **Visualization**
   - Visualizing customer segments, churn rates, and loyalty trends.
   - Interactive dashboards for real-time insights.
